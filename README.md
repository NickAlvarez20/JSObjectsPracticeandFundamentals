## Project Name
JS Objects Practice and Fundamentals
## About
This project is a collection of JavaScript exercises designed to deepen understanding of object-oriented programming concepts in JavaScript. It includes scripts that explore constructor functions, prototype-based inheritance, object literals, and the Object.create method, with practical examples such as cookie management, book details, and chef/meal simulations.
## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need JavaScript installed on your system. This can be achieved by:

-Using a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) with a JavaScript engine.

-Optionally, Node.js installed for running scripts outside the browser. 

-No additional libraries are required.
## Features
This JSObjectsPracticeandFundamentals project includes these features:

-Implementation of constructor functions for creating objects (e.g., Cookies, Meal).

-Use of prototype-based inheritance to add methods like eatCookie, describe, and countCookies.

-Exploration of Object.create for prototypal inheritance (e.g., sugarCookie, knife).

-Manipulation of object properties and methods using object literals (e.g., book, Chef).

## Getting Started & Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/NickAlvarez20/JSObjectsPracticeandFundamentals.git`
## Usage
Run the JavaScript scripts (e.g., ObjectConstructors.js, Objectcreate.js, book.js, review.js) using Node.js from the command line:

`node ObjectConstructors.js`

-Alternatively, open the scripts in a browser console or environment that supports JavaScript to interact with the code.

## Learning Outcomes
This project helped me:

-Master the creation and use of constructor functions and prototypes in JavaScript.

-Understand and apply Object.create for prototypal inheritance.

-Practice manipulating object properties and methods dynamically, including adding and deleting properties.

-Develop skills in writing clean, reusable, and modular JavaScript code.
